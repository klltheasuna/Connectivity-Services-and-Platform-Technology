## Why this project exists

- It demonstrates how to connect two applications through a shared API layer.
- It shows how to handle simple authentication, request routing, and response forwarding.
- It gives a practical example of tracing and logging interactions across services.
- It helps learners understand error handling and fault tolerance in a lightweight environment.

The work runs as a small learning project but is designed to be extended. You can add more sophisticated features as you grow your understanding of API design and distributed systems.

---

## Architecture and Design

- Core idea
  - A thin API gateway or bridge that routes requests between two apps.
  - The gateway enforces simple rules about what data can be exchanged and how responses are delivered.
- Key components
  - API Layer: Exposes endpoints for initiating connections, sending data, and receiving acknowledgments.
  - Connector Modules: Implement the specific logic to translate requests from one app into a form that the other app understands.
  - Data Transformer: Converts payloads between formats used by the two apps, maintaining consistency.
  - Logger: Records events, errors, and metrics to help with debugging and audits.
  - Security: Lightweight authentication, request validation, and rate limiting to keep the bridge healthy.
- Data flow
  - A client app calls the bridge with a request to connect or exchange data.
  - The bridge validates the request, transforms the data if needed, and forwards it to the destination app.
  - The destination app processes the data and returns a result.
  - The bridge conveys the result back to the original requester, optionally including a trace identifier for end-to-end observability.
- Extensibility
  - The architecture is modular. You can swap out the data transformer or the connector logic without rewiring the entire system.
  - It is designed to support additional connectors for more apps or protocols as needed.

---

## API Reference (High Level)

Note: This section describes the intended endpoints and data flows. The actual implementation may vary, but the concepts remain applicable.

- POST /connect
  - Purpose: Initiate a new cross-app connection session.
  - Request example: { "sourceApp": "AppA", "targetApp": "AppB", "payload": { "message": "hello" } }
  - Response example: { "sessionId": "abc123", "status": "initiated" }

- POST /exchange
  - Purpose: Send a message or data payload from one app to the other through the bridge.
  - Request example: { "sessionId": "abc123", "payload": { "data": "value" } }
  - Response example: { "sessionId": "abc123", "status": "delivered" }

- GET /status/{sessionId}
  - Purpose: Check the current status of a session.
  - Response example: { "sessionId": "abc123", "status": "completed", "lastUpdated": "2025-08-14T12:34:56Z" }

- POST /callback
  - Purpose: Receive asynchronous confirmations or responses from the destination app.
  - Request example: { "sessionId": "abc123", "result": { "ack": true } }

- GET /health
  - Purpose: Health check for the bridge service.
  - Response: 200 OK with status payload

- GET /docs
  - Purpose: Self-contained API docs for developers.

Security and permissions
- API keys or OAuth tokens can be used to authorize requests.
- Scopes define what actions a client can perform (connect, exchange, status checks).
- Validation guards ensure payloads meet schema expectations.

---

## Data Model and Contracts

- Session
  - id: string
  - sourceApp: string
  - targetApp: string
  - status: string (initiated, in-progress, completed, failed)
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - lastUpdated: timestamp
- Payload
  - type: string (json, xml, etc.)
  - content: string or binary representation
  - metadata: object (optional)
- AuditLog
  - id: string
  - sessionId: string
  - event: string
  - timestamp: timestamp
  - details: string (optional)

- Versioning
  - Endpoints and payload contracts should be versioned.
  - Version can be included in headers or as part of the request body to support backward compatibility.

---

## Security Considerations

- Use strong authentication for all bridging operations. JWT or OAuth tokens are recommended.
- Validate all inputs strictly. Avoid accepting untrusted payloads without validation.
- Encrypt data in transit using TLS. Consider encryption at rest for sensitive information.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect the bridge from traffic spikes.
- Maintain an audit trail for all cross-app exchanges to support troubleshooting and compliance.

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Unit tests
  - Validate individual modules such as the API layer, transformer, and connector logic.
- Integration tests
  - Mock the source and destination apps to verify end-to-end flows.
- End-to-end tests
  - Exercise the entire lifecycle from connect to exchange to status checks.
- Performance tests
  - Test under load to measure latency and throughput.
  - Check behavior when the destination app is slow to respond.
- Security tests
  - Validate access control and input validation through targeted tests.

Test data should be isolated from production-like data to avoid accidental leakage.

---

## Development and Local Setup

- Prerequisites:
  - Node.js (latest LTS)
  - npm or yarn
  - Docker (optional for containerized runs)
- Installing dependencies
  - npm install
  - yarn install
- Local environment setup
  - Create a .env.local file with required keys:
    - BRIDGE_PORT
    - SOURCE_APP_BASE_URL
    - TARGET_APP_BASE_URL
    - API_KEY or OAUTH_CONFIG
  - Ensure the values reflect your local or test environment.
- Running the project
  - npm run dev
  - If you use Docker, there should be a docker-compose.yml to spin up the bridge along with any dependencies.
- Verifying the local run
  - Access http://localhost:<port>/health to confirm the service is up.
  - Use a REST client to send test requests to /connect or /exchange.

Best practices
- Use a local duck-typed mock for the destination app when testing.
- Keep your test data separate from any real user data.
- Log enough information to diagnose issues but avoid exposing sensitive details.

---

## Sample Workflows and Examples

- Example 1: Simple text exchange
  - Client calls POST /connect with sourceApp = "AppA" and targetApp = "AppB".
  - Bridge validates and creates a session, returns sessionId.
  - Client calls POST /exchange with the sessionId and payload with a text message.
  - Bridge forwards to AppB, AppB responds, Bridge returns confirmation to AppA.

- Example 2: Binary payload exchange
  - Client sends a binary payload encoded as base64.
  - Bridge uses the Data Transformer to reformat for AppB.
  - The example demonstrates how to handle different payload formats in a clean, extendable way.

- Example 3: Callback handling
  - Destination app sends a callback to /callback with results or acknowledgment.
  - Bridge updates the session status and notifies the source app if required.

- Example 4: Error handling
  - If a request fails validation, the bridge returns a detailed error payload with a clear message and a code.
  - The client can interpret the code to adjust its behavior (e.g., retry policy, validation fixes).

- Example 5: Observability
  - Every interaction includes a traceId and is written to a structured log.
  - Use dashboards to monitor performance and health.

---

## Development Patterns and Best Practices

- Keep modules small and cohesive. Each module should have a clear responsibility.
- Favor explicit data contracts. Little ambiguity reduces integration errors.
- Prefer explicit errors and informative messages. Client code benefits from clarity.
- Write tests that reflect real-world usage. Simulate both success and failure paths.
- Document the API in plain language and with examples. Include request and response formats.
- Use versioning for endpoints and payload schemas to avoid breaking changes.
- Maintain a changelog with each release to track improvements and fixes.

---

## Accessibility and Internationalization

- Prepare the API to support multiple languages for messages or responses that are user-facing.
- Consider using locale-aware formatting for dates, numbers, and times.
- Ensure error messages are clear and actionable for users from different regions.
